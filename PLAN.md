Here is a general outline of how you can go about building an app in React TypeScript for storing your DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) or WAV files and integrating with FL Studio:

1. Set up a React project with TypeScript
   First, you will need to set up a new React project with TypeScript. You can do this by using Create React App with the --template typescript flag to generate a new project.

```bash
npx create-react-app my-daw-app --template typescript
```

2. Create a file storage system
   You can create a file storage system within your React app where you can store your DAW or WAV files. This can be done using the built-in browser File API or by using a backend server to handle file storage. You can use tools like multer or AWS S3 for file storage.

3. Integrate with FL Studio
   To integrate with FL Studio, you can use the FL Studio API or an external plugin that allows communication with the software. You can use the FL Studio ReWire feature to sync your app with FL Studio and send audio data back and forth.

4. Organize your songs
   You can create a database or use local storage to keep track of your songs and their associated files. You can store metadata like song title, artist name, genre, etc., along with the file paths to the DAW or WAV files.

5. Build a user interface
   Create a user interface for your app where you can view, organize, and access your songs and files. You can display a list of songs with their metadata and provide options for playing, editing, and managing the files.

6. Testing and deployment
   Once you have built your app, make sure to test it thoroughly to ensure it works as expected. You can deploy your app to a hosting service like Vercel or Netlify for public access.

By following these steps, you should be able to build an app in React TypeScript that stores your DAW or WAV files and integrates with FL Studio to keep your songs organized.
